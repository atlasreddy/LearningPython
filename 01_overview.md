##Python Overview

**Python** : Python is an easy to learn, powerful high level programming language. It is a general purpose high level programming
language. Python was developed by the Dutch Programmer Guido van Rossum.  And is managed by Python Software Foundation (PSF).

By the way, the language is named after the BBC show “Monty Python’s Flying Circus” and has nothing to do with reptiles.

**_Features of Python_**: 
- >**Simple and easy to learn**: Python is a simple programming language. When compared with other programming languages, python programs can be developed with lesser number of lines. Hence, comes more readability and simplicity. The syntax is very simple. Developing programs using python language, feels like writing a story.  
- >**Freeware and Open Source**: It's source code is open, so that we can customize based on our requirement. No license is required for using python software and hence freeware.
- >**Platform Independent and Portability**: Python programs are portable, on all the platforms, it'll provide the same results. Python supports for write once run anywhere (WORA), which means it is platform independent.
- >**Interpreted**: Once we write a python program, we are not required to compile the code explicitly. Python virtual Machine (PVM) is responsible for conversion of python code to machine understandable format. If compilation fails, the interpreter will raise syntax errors. Once we fix those errors, the compilation will succeed, and then PVM is responsible to execute the code.
- >**Dynamically Typed**: In Python, we're not required to declare the type of the variable. The type will be automatically allocated based on the value assigned to that variable. Hence, it is considered as Dynamically Typed language. This feature provides more flexibility to the programmer while variable declaration and assignment.
- >**Procedural and Object-Oriented**: Python language supports developing of applications using both procedural and object-oriented way.  This is one of the main features of python language. 
- >**Versatile**: Python is a versatile language, as it covers the maximum area of software development, and it is the most used programming language now-a-days. The popular tech giants like Google, Youtube, Instagram etc. are developed using the python or it's relevant frameworks.

**_Versions of Python_**: 
- Python 1.0 Released in January 1994.
- Python 2.0 released in October 2000.
- Python 2.7 released in July 2010. [the last version of 2.x]
- Python 3.0 released in December 2008 also known as py3k or python 3000.
- Python 3.6 released in December 2016.
- Python 3.9 released in October 2020. 

As of January 2020, Python 2.x is no longer supported by Python Software Foundation (PSF). 

**_Important point to Note_**: Python 3.x version is a new version that is incompatible with python 2.x . In other words, there is no guarantee that the Python 2.x code will execute in Python 3.x software.

**_Where we can use Python_**:

1. For developing of web applications
2. For developing of Desktop applications
3. For Network Programming
4. For developing games
5. For developing database applications
6. For Data Analysis, Machine Learning applications
7. For developing of computer vision and natural language processing applications
8. For developing of Internet of Things (IOT) applications 

And many more.

####Installation of Python software: 
In order to run python programs, we need to install python software on our system. Unlike any other software installation, the python software installation is simple and straight forward.  

How do you verify whether the system is able to execute python code or not ? 

In order to find it out, open the terminal / CMD and then just type ```python --version``` and press enter. If we could see something like ```Python 3.7.7``` or whatever, without any error message like _command not found_, then we are good enough to execute the python programs in the system.
