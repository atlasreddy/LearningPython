Write and execute a program for  Electricity Bill calculation using the data given below.
Input: previous reading, current reading
Output: number of units consumed, consumer charge, consumption charge, Total Bill.

[0-100] [Including 0 and 100]
0-50 -- 1.95/unit. consumer = 50
51-100 -- 3.10/unit. consummer = 80
[101-200]
0-100 -- 3.40/unit. consumer = 100
101-200 -- 4.80/unit. consumer = 100
[201, +++]
0-200  5.10/unit.   consumer = 110
201-300 7.70/unit.  consumer = 110
301-400 9.00/unit.  consumer = 130
401-800 9.50/unit.   consumer = 150
> 800   10/unit.     consumer = 170
total charge = units consumption charge + consumer charge
minimum total charge is 125

Round off the total charge to the next nearest multiple of 5.
For example:
160 -> 160
161 -> 165
166 -> 170
169 -> 170

Note: This assignment aims for the understanding the concepts of conditional flow control, arithmetic operators, variables.
