1. Find out the version of python you're using.
2. List out all the keywords of your specific version of python.
3. List out the fundamental data types in Python programming language.

4. Check when the interconversion between the variables possible.
int -> str
float -> str
float -> int
str -> int
str -> float
str -> int
and vice-versa.
For what kind of values the conversions are possible.
Figure out the edge cases like int("q"), int("1)" and so on.

5. string1 = "python classes"
For the above string, try out all the possible index accessing, string slicing.
Example: string1[100], string1[5], string1[0:6], string1[-8], string1[-56] etc.
Make a conclusion about the string slicing, accessing a particular location in the string.

6. Write and execute a program to print the first name, last name, sum of first and last name.
7. print(first_name, last_name)
How the output of the above command can be achieved in question 6.
You are not supposed to use , in the print function. Only concatenation can be used.

NOTE: This assignment is focused on the data type casting, string understanding. So Questions 1 to 5 can be put in a txt file.
