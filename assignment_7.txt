1. Think of five simple foods offered in restaurant and store them in a tuple.
    Use for loop to print each food.
    Modify the food present at the middle position, and make sure that it throws the error. What is the error.
    After few days, restaurant launched new menu of items, replacing the two items with the different food items. Add a line,
    that rewrites an initially declared tuple and then use a for loop to print each of the items in the revised menu.

2. Use a list comprehension to generate the list of cubes of natural numbers upto a user entered number.
    Convert the list to tuple.
    Use for loop to print the values, in such a way that, 5 values per line and each value is separated by the comma(,) and tab space.

3. Use while loop to
    Prompt the user to enter the positive number, until the user enters the positive number.
    print the natural numbers in the descending order from the user entered number.
